<p>A laptop combines the components and inputs of a desktop computer, including display, speakers, and keyboard and pointing device (such as a touchpad or a track pad) into a single device. Most modern-day laptops also have an</p>
 <p>integrated webcam and a microphone. A laptop can be powered either from a rechargeable battery, or by mains electricity via an AC adapter. Laptop is a diverse category of devices and other more specific terms, such as rugged notebook or convertible, </p>
 refer to specialist types of laptops, which have been optimized for specific uses. </p>
 <p>Hardware specifications change significantly between different types, makes and models of laptops.<p>
<p>Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market, mostly for specialized field applications, such as the military, accountancy, for sales representatives etc.</p>
 <p>As portable computers developed and became more like modern laptops, becoming smaller, lighter, cheaper, and more powerful, they became very widely used for a variety of purposes. [3]</p>
